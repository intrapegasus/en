## Resolution (Completion Stage)

PR060606NW was made very quickly in less than 1 month and has met expectations which are quite satisfying with simple and makeshift infrastructure but can still be made without having to use fancy infrastructure because limitations are not a barrier in making works after having to fail in EOL-112222 with this As a commitment, I offer 10 years long term support (LTS) from 2022 to 2032 as long as you are a customer on PR060606W and as long as I am given a lifespan in life.

* Facebook is used as content curation or behind-the-scenes stories about how to create content on all of these platforms and is also used when something additional or an upcoming event will be posted so customers don't miss the latest news or anything that is interesting either from live broadcast sessions or regular posts, either text, images and videos.

* Instagram is used for sharing photos more or less the same as on EOL-112222, there is no difference but customers can get stories for the last 24 hours in real time about what I am working on also not used for something serious like Facebook , more specifically for a young audience, even though the old ones can still get permission to enter.

* Twitter is used for something that is serious combined with things that are not serious, the target audience is more adults but there are no restrictions for young people who want to see what threads are made, there are no pictures, only text, so that priority is given to people who are diligent or like to read, not recommended for people who are lazy to read.

* YouTube is used as freemium or free content that users are required to log in using a google account to view and are not allowed to download externally, external download permission is available for those who pay with restrictions may not be re-uploaded on any platform, available for additional entertainment for those who have previously subscribed or previously unsubscribed or people who have never subscribed by viewing available videos without having to pay any additional fees.

* Content creation is carried out with several levels of difficulty according to the internet speed as well as the idea, "Facebook, Instagram & YouTube" uses an internet connection from Telkomsel in 3G mode while "Twitter" uses an internet connection from Tri in 2G mode. This is differentiated so that customers can know that all content creation is based on seriousness as well as using something that is not cheap and not easy so that they can appreciate it more and do not suffer the same fate as EOL-112222, customers get what they pay for and according to the benefits they get as customer appreciation of Content creation is carried out with several levels of difficulty according to the internet speed as well as the idea, "Facebook, Instagram & YouTube" uses an internet connection from Telkomsel in 3G mode while "Twitter" uses an internet connection from Tri in 2G mode.

* By becoming my customer at PR060606NW, you will help to appreciate what I do and I thank you very much for being part of PR060606NW, I don't mean to do commercialization basically but EOL-112222 with a donation system none of the content connoisseurs do appreciation for what I do, I do this not for the purpose of money but at least with what I give beyond what you have paid so far, you get work on EOL-112222 also you get it on PR060606NW, the donation system does not automatically make you join PR060606NW but only applies to EOL-112222 only. Content payment schemes, as well as special requests from you such as knowing the latest resumes and research are also different.
