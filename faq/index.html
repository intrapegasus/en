                 <p>This question appeared in an Instagram post for a high school class account on November 9, 2016 and the post was liked by 19 people when this FAQ was created. Actually I like to be photographed but unfortunately I'm confused whether anyone misses me because I'm not a smart student, also of course my face is mediocre so when I'm being photographed I just don't feel confident so I rarely show up, thank you for asking this question, leave greetings from me to you.  </p>

                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                <p>There are more than 10 twitter accounts that seem to have been registered, this is based on my search with the keyword "Azhar Basyiri" and the account is an account that was created by me because previously I registered to twitter only via sms using the bakrie telecom operator or esia whose operator also no longer exists, one of those accounts does not use a password, an account that was created during junior high school and its contents do not really match my current condition, when I was in junior high I was also a teenager in an emotionally unstable condition who had mental health problems so the post maybe silly.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                <p>Yes, I control it both in search engines to social media, I can't control everything about my digital footprint because it's very complicated and based on a priority scale whether the information is important to delete or not, only some can coordinate, namely Microsoft and google, for twitter can't coordinate for this so I have no idea for that and leave the information available but not for hiding purposes but updating the data to make it more relevant every time, of course you too have digital traces that are difficult to delete just like me . I'm just controlling it, I don't mean to delete everything or make it worse. </p>

                <p> Actually there are many that I like but they don't like me, but I try to remember again but remember, I'm not a playboy, the name is also love monkey, right. When I was in elementary school I liked "Susi", In middle school I liked: "Hanifah, Nadilah & Farah", In high school I liked "Masriah & Savira".

                <p> Oops, what other question is this. I don't like ghosting, if ghosting is caused because I am confused if women have no interest in me but I have had a long conversation and I'm the only one who actively asks something but he doesn't then I'm right to do ghosting, goodbye is only for the right person not for everyone, maybe I seem selfish but with this at least it gives an idea that I want to be respected as I value women, forgive me if it feels wrong, I hope it doesn't happen again. </p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                <p> Until this question was made in 2022 I am not married at the age of 23, many of these questions have been asked of me and I am not afraid to face this, I may now want to prioritize certain people first who care about me and I also care about that person, I'm dizzy thinking about love problems because there is no match for a match, many PDKT have failed, it doesn't mean I don't try, I've been trying to find a suitable candidate but haven't met so the priority is changing not to get married but to make someone you love happy, it doesn't have to be a girlfriend, because love doesn't have to have, I'm also not established and no one can accept my shortcomings so I'll just get married sometime. </p>

Then the next thing is to pick up the book to "Ayumi" my high school friend and I really regret this because I am selfish and don't want to study properly, it was purely my fault and I really regret it, I hope other regrets will not happen in the future. my life because there is karma that I have felt when I was mean to someone. So I have to suppress my emotions so as not to overdo it nor hurt someone's feelings or physically. </p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                <p> I am not ashamed to be poor, nor am I ashamed to have poor parents. Because I'm not like other young people who always carry the names of their parents but they are nothing. I struggled from the bottom so I know what it's like and what it's like to be poor, I'm not jealous of other rich young people because it's their parents who are rich, not them. It's easy for me to break the argument of the rich when it comes to demeaning the poor. All humans are actually born not having anything that distinguishes rich and poor, only humans themselves. </p>
