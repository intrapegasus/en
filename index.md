## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/azhar.jpg">

I am Azhar Basyiri Hartono (Azhar) was born in Pemalang, Central Java, Indonesia on April 19, 1999 and comes from a broken home and poor family, a high school graduate and did not go to college but I can prove that low education is not a barrier in doing something good by starting slowly but surely, no need to hesitate in doing something because I have gone through failure many times but I can rise and be great, I do not give up.

## Glimpse Of Myself

I study various aspects of life lessons, sometimes I don't even need to take something seriously that makes me sad, on the Internet or in the real world it's the same. You know that my grades are not as good as my friends but grades are not everything, I have lived life from the bottom and I feel how difficult life is, learning does not always have to be from school but can be from anywhere, research whatever is available and store it in the brain then run it in everyday life then knowledge will be useful not only for yourself but for others

## Music Albums

I have also made music even though my background is not a musician, the album of songs that I created is public domain and I do not receive any money, I want to create something that is open and free to anyone without commercialization
