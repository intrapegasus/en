<ul>
<li>The description of the security hole is kept secret (Only for internal parties from Bukalapak ; the vulnerability has been reported through BukaBounty) for user safety</li>

<li>Bug (25-12-2021): I as the former owner of Tasya ID Media found a zero day attack that can't be fixed, this finding was found by me while visiting the interstitial page of Tasya ID Media which forced downloads, the visit was made with an Apple device and has not been found on an Android device or Computer, Tasya ID Media does not provide download files in any form and does not force users to take download actions, the source code of the website from Tasya ID Media does not provide source code malicious and all source code is publicly available </li>
<li>Fixed (28-12-2021): This issue was resolved by a third-party independent researcher; Errors on WebKit when experiencing heavy activity by running a series of activities on the browser by opening tabs a lot or quickly or closing tabs and immediately opening certain static web-based websites will result in triggering downloads accidentally, the solution is to periodically delete cookies and cache and if wanting to turn off JavaScript is recommended for visitors when visiting static websites, this bug is harmless but users should still be careful not to click download if a pop up appears on the first visit because the integrity of the website is questionable whether it is original or compromised by malicious source code from hacker</li>
